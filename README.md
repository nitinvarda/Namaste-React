# Namaste React (Ep1 - Intution)


## what is CDN ?
```
A content delivery network (CDN) is a geographically distributed group of servers that caches content close to end users. A CDN allows for the quick transfer of assets needed for loading Internet content, including HTML pages, JavaScript files, stylesheets, images, and videos.
```

## what is crossorigin ?
```
The crossorigin attribute sets the mode of the request to an HTTP CORS Request.
Web pages often make requests to load resources on other servers. Here is where CORS comes in.
A cross-origin request is a request for a resource (e.g. style sheets, iframes, images, fonts, or scripts) from another domain.
```

## Quick Notes

```
reactDOM will replace content in root, not append.

# Namaste React (Ep3 - Laying Foundation)

### Babel
```
    is JS compiler
```



### JSX 
```
    JSX is not HTML, what ever we write in JSX is an Object will be converted to HTML later

    Major differences
    HTML        || JSX
    class       || className
    tabindex    || tabIndex



    it santizes data before running it in browser
```



### React Components
```
Class Based & Functional Components

- Functional Components
-- a javascript funcitons returns JSX element
```
